      <h3>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Colin studied at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where he proved himself not only an avid <a href="http://www.uwbadgers.com/#">Badger sports fan</a>, but also a brilliant cheesemaker with a specialty in punching the holes into Swiss cheese. In 2005, Colin's groundbreaking cheese hole punching technique garnered him international acclaim and he was awarded the Cheez-It Cheese Maker of the Year award. Following this lofty recognition, Colin went on to co-found CheeseMe, Inc. - the world's #1 cheese producer - with his friends, Michael Chum Monty and Brady Nicholas Barton. He now lives in Minnesota and enjoys spending time at his cabin near Madison, Wisconsin with his family and friends.
